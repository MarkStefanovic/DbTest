### Purpose
The purpose of this library is to aid in the creation of readable, maintainable, business-logic tests against data stored in SQL databases.  


### Features 
- automatic serialization of rules and tests to making storing to external sources easy
- automatic tracking of execution times to help asses the cost of a test
 

### ToDos
- implement `mostly`, `flex`, and `flexPercent` logic
- add multi-table tests at specified granularity
- implement `fastRowCount` option for row-count tests
- implement `caseSensitive` option on text rules
- test against PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Oracle
- add unit-tests for each rule
